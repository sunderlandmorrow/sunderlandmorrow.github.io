							<h2 class="major">Building a Dome</h2>

							<p>
								This is a dome I designed and constructed after my apprenticeship at Cal-Earth Institute. It now serves as a tea house that is offered on Airbnb Experiences in Grass Valley, CA. Help with labor came from generous friends and family members.
								The following outlines the construction of this dome.

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/4.12.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

								<a href="#work"></a>
							</p>





							<p>First, I started by drawing a floorplan, a sectional view, as well as created a scaled down model of the dome.<p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/2.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/3b.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/1b.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/2b.jpg" alt="" /></span>

							<p>Then it was time to begin building the full-scale sctructure. The first step was to use a compass system to draw the footing of the dome and then dig it out.<a href="#Project2"></a></p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/3.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/4.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

							<p>The method of construction for this dome uses three main materials, polypropylene bags, barbed wire, and an earthen mix. The bags come in a continuous roll and can be cut to any length needed. The layers of bag are filled with a certain ratio of clay and sand and are then tamped flat with a cast iron tamper. Bags are filled up in place on the structure by using small containers about the size of a coffee can. Barbed wires goes in between the layers of each bag to provide friction as well as tensile strength. <a href="#Project2"></a></p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/5.1.png" alt="" /></span>

							<p>The first few layers of bag are filled with 3/4 inch gravel so that water doesn't collect around the footing of the dome during the rainy season. Layers are then stacked and tamped flat. Each layer is precisely placed according to the compass system.  <a href="#Project2"></a></p>



							<span class="image main"><img src="images/1d.jpg" alt="" /></span>

							<p>Here is a model of the compass system I created in order to help people understand how the dome is geometrically conceived. The first few layers of this dome are exactly 12' in diameter, essentially a cylinder. A 6' long chain attached to a pole at the center of the dome acts as a compass to ensure each layer is perfectly circular.
							<p>At an arbitrary layer, the circumference of each layer begins to shrink. How much this circumference should decrease is dictated by the compass on the right. This measurement can be transferred to the center compass such that it can be used to measure 360 degrees. Each layer, the compass is calibrated so that ultimately a dome is created. </p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/44o.jpg" alt="" /></span>

							<p>Temporary forms made out of recycled materials are put into place on the structure. These forms will be removed to allow for windows and a door to be installed later on.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/2d.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/3d.jpg" alt="" /></span>

							<p>A cement based earthen mix is put inside of the bags only around openings so that permanent arches will remain when the temporary forms are removed. </p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/6b.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>The final layers are then filled and tamped flat, completing the shell of the structure.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/1j.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/2j.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/a.jpg" alt="" /></span>


							<p>After completing the shell of the structure it was time to begin all of the tedius finish work. First up was a rough coat of cement based plaster followed by a smooth second coat.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/1k.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/2k.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/3k.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>I also added some steps up the side of the dome.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/ak.jpg" alt="" /></span>

							<p>I then installed a standard sized door and three roman arch windows and then masked off everything to prepare for paint.</p>
							<p>The paint used is a an elastomeric which is essentially a rubberized paint that will prevent any rain from penetrating the dome.</p>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/8k.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/ik.jpg" alt="" /></span>

							<p>After installing the door, there was empty space above the door that I filled with brown bottles mortered together. At night, the light from inside of the dome shines through the bottles, producing a beautiful glowing wall. </p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/6gk.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/test.jpg" alt="" /></span>

							<p>Now it was time to begin working on the interior of the dome. First off, I did a rough coat of clay, straw and sand plaster followed by a rough coat of lime plaster. These coats of plaster are not meant to look pleasing to the eye, the more textured they are the better the subsequent layers will adhere.  </p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/1o.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/2o.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/3o.jpg" alt="" /></span>

							<p>The last coat of plaster was a smooth layer of lime plaster. </p>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/4o.jpg" alt="" /></span>

							<p>To make this dome more welcoming, I installed a few modern amenities. First, I installed electricity so that the dome could have a ceiling fan with overhead lighting. I also installed a single outlet into the floor. I also built a custom wood burning stove which is an entirely different project that can be seen under Project 4. Lastly, I installed a tile floor. </p>
							<p> Here is the finished interior:</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/4.12.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/5o.jpg" alt="" /></span>

							<p> <a href="#Project2"></a></p>

							<p>
								This dome is now being frequently used as a tea house via Airbnb and works perfectly for doing so. It provides a truly unique environment and always leaves guests wondering about its unusual construction.

							<p>
								A popular YouTube channel asked to film a short video about this dome. The video can be seen here:

							<h2 class="major">Mercedes Restoration</h2>
							<p>Here is a 1984 Mercedes 300d I picked up for a low price. The body and interior were in great shape although the mechanicals of the car needed a lot of work. The engine was leaking oil from many different spots and parking this car would result in permanently stained driveways.
							<p>The goal of this project was to refurbish the engine and assess any further repairs to make the car reliable and leak free. The following is the documentation of the mechanical restoration I did to this car.
							<p></p> <i>All components/gaskets replaced are listed at the end of this documentation. </i> </p> </p>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/2.1.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

							<p> First, I decided to pull the engine as some of the gaskets can only be replaced if the engine is out of the car.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/2.3.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

							<p>Before working on the engine, I cleaned all of the 30+ years of caked on engine oil from the engine bay. I also installed a new hood insulation pad.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/2.5.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/2.6.jpeg" alt="" /></span>


							<p>With a clean home for the engine to return to, I turned my attention towards the engine itself. I mounted the engine to an engine stand so it was easier to work on. I then did a preliminary degreasing on the engine as well as removed any extraneous parts and labeled every single nut bolt and screw.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/2.8.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/2.8.1.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/2.7.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

							<p>All of the parts that I removed were cleaned thoroughly. I also removed the transmission after learning it would be easier to reinstall the engine with the transmission attached to it.</p>

							<p>Here are all of the parts that will be reused, cleaned up as best as possible.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/2.9.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/2.10.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

							<p>Here is the engine all cleaned up.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/2.11.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/2.12.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

							<p>I wanted the engine to look as good as it could so I painted it with black engine enamel, as the original black paint had come off over the years.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/2.13.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/2.14a.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

							<p>Next, it was time to replace the rear crank shaft seal as well as inspect the rod/main bearings for excessive wear. First I removed the oil pump as well as the camshaft sprocket.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/2.14.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/2.15.jpeg" alt="" /></span>


							<p>Removing the main and connecting rod bearing caps: </p>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/2.17.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

							<p>Now the crankshaft was able to be removed.</p>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/2.18.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/2.19.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

							<p>I labeled the main and connecting rod bearing caps with respect to the exact position in which they originally came from, as per the factory engine manual. I discovered that the main and rod bearings were significantly worn. This was to be expected after 230k miles. I then sourced some original bearings from Mercedes. The dealership in Sacramento was able to locate some in Germany and had them sent over.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/2.20.jpeg" alt="" /></span>


							<p>Here is the comparison between old and new bearings. The old ones are on the right:</p>


							<span class="image main"><img src="images/2.21.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/2.22.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

							<p>With the crankshaft back from the machine shop, I reassembled the bottom internals of the engine using a properly calibrated torque wrench. I was able to find all of the factory spec torque values in the Mercedes dealership service manual. </p>


							<span class="image main"><img src="images/2.23.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/2.24.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/2.25.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/2.26.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

							<p>I then reinstalled the fuel injection pump, also setting the approximately correct timing.</p>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/2.27.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

							<p>I reinstalled every component I had originally removed, as well as adjusted the valve clearance for each piston.</p>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/2.28.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/2.29.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

							<p>I replaced the clutch and pressure plate and bolted the transmission onto the aft end of the engine. Now it was all ready to go back into the car.</p>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/a.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/2.30.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/2.31.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/2.32.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/2.33.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/2.34.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

							Now that the engine is back in the car, I began reconnecting every electrical and mechanical connection. Then fired the car up to adjust the timing. After some adjusting, the engine ran beautifully.

							<h2 class="major">Oldsmobile Restoration</h2>
							<p>This project documents the mechanical restoration of my late grandfather's 1964 Oldsmobile. It was passed down to my father and then passed down to me. The main focus of this project was to rebuild the engine as it was knocking horribly and would barely run. </p>
							</p> <i>All components/gaskets replaced are listed at the end of this documentation. </i> </p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/3.1.jpeg" alt="" /></span>


							<p>The first step was to remove the hood to allow room for the engine and transmission to come out as one unit.</p>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/3.2.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

							<p>The engine to be removed:</p>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/3.3.jpeg" alt="" /></span>


							<p>After disconnecting the driveshaft and all other mechanical/electrical connections, I successfully pulled the engine and transmission. </p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/3.4.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/3.5.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

							<p>I gave it a preliminary cleaning so it would be easier to work on.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/3.6.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

							<p>I then began dissasembling the engine to prepare for the rebuild.</p>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/3.9.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/3.7.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/3.10.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/3.11.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

							<p>Here is the engine bay all cleaned up. I wish I had a before picture, as there was oil and grime from 50+ years caked on everywhere. I initially used a credit card to scrape off layers and layers of debris. Eventually I used degreaser and this was the result:</p>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/3.12.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

							<p>I then removed the fenders and the wheel wells so I could repaint the frame and the engine bay. I also had the paint matched and repainted the white areas for continuity. </p>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/3.13.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/3.14.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/3.15.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

							<p>All machine work was done by a friend of a friend who specializes rebuilding Oldsmobile engines. The machine work was done by him as I shadowed and the reassembly and paint work was done by me.   </p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/1.png" alt="" /></span>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/11.png" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/12.png" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/13.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>I brought the engine back home, and installed all of the other components. I also figured it would be easiest if I installed the engine with the whole front end still removed. </p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/14.png" alt="" /></span>

							<p>Installing the engine was quite easy with the front end still being off of the car.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/3.16.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>I then began reinstalling the front end parts, all of which I repainted or restored in some way or another.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/3.17.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/3.18.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Then I carefully reinstalled the fenders: </p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/3.19.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/3.20.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>The only thing left to do was reinstall the hood and front bumper.</p>

							<center><b>After:</b></center>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/3.22.jpeg" alt="" /></span>




							<p>After some fine tuning, this 1964 Oldsmobile runs perfectly. The engine, prior to rebuild, was about ready to lock up. Upon removal of the oil pan, I discovered metal fragments which indicated a spun bearing and ultimately an engine with not much time left. Given some more driving, the engine would have seized up and potentially ruined what could have been rebuilt. Luckily this was caught and the engine was rebuilt at the right time. Now, with a clean bill of health, this car will be trouble free for years to come.    </p>

								<h2 class="major">Rocket Stove</h2>
								<form method="post" action="#">


									<p>In order to be comfortable in the dome during the winter, a heater of some sort must be used. After much research, I settled on building a rocket stove. It is a highly efficient wood burning stove that uses significantly less wood than a traditional wood burning stove. I read a few books on the subject and with that knowledge I set out to build one.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/4.12.jpeg" alt="" /></span>


									<p>I first drew a floor plan of the system.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/4.1.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

									<p>I then made a mock setup of the core of the system to see where the chimney would approximately exit.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/4.2.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

									<p>I then carved a hole for the chimney with a hammer and chisel.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/4.3.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

									<p>Next I measured, cut, and assembled the stovepipe accordingly.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/4.4.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

									<p>Since the concrete floor is essentially a massive heatsink, I built an elevated buffer between the floor and the stovepipe. By using aluminum and perlite, the heat will not as easily transfer into the floor.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/4.5.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

									<p>Then I built the core of the system without yet mortaring all of the bricks together. This was to double check my measurements before permanently building the core.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/4.6.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

									<p>With everything lining up perfectly, I then mortared all of the bricks together. I also built an octagonal shaped manifold underneath the barrel so the exhaust gases would flow through and into the stovepipe on the right.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/4.7.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

									<p>Now, it was time to fill in all of the empty areas with any kind of thermal mass I could find. I used broken bricks, old piece of concrete, and rocks. Ultimately this thermal mass would absorb the heat energy flowing through the stovepipe and hold onto it providing a nice and warm bench to sit on. I then rendered the bench using an earthen mix I made and the rough shape of the bench had taken form.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/4.9.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

									<p>I then refined the bench shape with many layers of lime plaster. I also painted the bench and walls with limewash as well as painstakingly cut and installed black tiles for the finished floor. Ultimately this was the finished product:  </p>
									

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/4.11.jpeg" alt="" /></span>


									<span class="image main"><img src="images/4.10.jpeg" alt="" /></span>


									<span class="image main"><img src="images/4.12.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/4.13.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/4.14.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										Because of the proportions of the system, the draft sucks the flame towards the right and into the barrel. The smoke is then combusted in the barrel and then it passes through the rest of the system. Most of the heat is extracted and stored in the bench. The exhaust that comes out of the chimney is a bit of water vapor and it is lukewarm.
									</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/t.jpeg" alt="" /></span>


									<p>Operation of this stove has been relatively low maintenance with great results. It not only provides abundant warmth for guests but also a cozy ambiance. </p>
